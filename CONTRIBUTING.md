## Setup

This project is built with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), see the `pom.xml` in the root folder.

The tests provide temporary credentials (see [BaseTestCase](src/test/java/com/uwetrottmann/trakt5/BaseTestCase.java)),
so running tests should just work.
If an unauthorized error is returned, let me know that the test credentials need to be refreshed.
